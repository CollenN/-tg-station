* Away missions are disabled for now.  They may be reactivated later<br>
<br>
* I apologize for the changes /tg/ made to the map.<br><br>
<u><b>News</b> (above and beyond the /tg/ changelog:</u><br>
* I am testing out a new mail system.  Please report any problems and tell me what needs work.<br>
* Let me know if you see anything wrong with storage items.<br>
* If you have trouble identifying chems in a beaker, try using science goggles.<br>
<br>
<u>The following features are unique to Sayustation:</u><br>
* Lighted tiles produce light (Bugfix submitted but not yet accepted by /tg/)<br>
* The Toolbelt of Holding (More slots, carries different things.  Research required.)<br>
* * Some people choose justice.  Sometimes, justice chooses you.<br>
* Booze and other junk can be found hidden throughout the station.<br>
* You can move vending machines after prying them up with a crowbar.  This is probably a terrible idea.<br>
* The station is dirty!  Where's the janitor?<br>
* Analyzing beakers and bottles by eye isn't a sure thing.<br>
* There are random chemicals in Chemistry to be identified (And random booze in the bar).<br>
* Soap has limited use and can be crafted (Ammonia, corn oil, universal enzyme)<br>
