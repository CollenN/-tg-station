   changes: 
     - rscadd: "Added two categories of mutant bodyparts for humans with the same system that lizards use: ears and tails. Right now only admins can edit these."
     - rscadd: "Updated the system that checks for which jobs your character qualifies to be species-dependant. At this moment you won't notice any differences, but in the future coders can use this to be more specific about which jobs a species is allowed in under which circumstances."
     - imageadd: "Added one option to both categories, taken from the kitty ears: a cat tail and cat ears."
     - rscadd: "Added a new button to the VV menu drop-down list for admins: Toggle Purrbation. Putting a human on purrbation will give them cat ears and a cat tail, and send them the message 'You suddenly feel valid.' Using the button a second time removes the effects."
     - wip: "Adding categories for tattoos and scars is in the works. (Read: I need sprites!)"
