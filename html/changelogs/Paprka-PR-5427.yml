changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added an advanced mop for the janitor, available at the protolathe. This hi-tech custodian's friend can mop twice as many floor tiles before needing to return to your bucket!"
  - tweak: "Moved holosign projector to the protolathe and gave the janitor back his old signs. We hope you've enjoyed this free trial run of holo projectors, but our budget is tight!"
  - rscadd: "Added a holosign projector to the janitor module for cyborgs."
  - tweak: "Soap now has a delay. Different soap types clean faster than others, but expect to put it some extra arm work if you want to clean that fresh blood!"
