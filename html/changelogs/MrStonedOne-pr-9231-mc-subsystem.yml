# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
#	Fuck you and your tab-less "y m l"
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - experiment: "MasterController and subsystem rejiggering!"
  - rscadd: "The MC can now dynamcially change the rate a subsystem is triggered based on how laggy it's being. This has been applied to atmos to allow for faster air processing without lagging the server"
  - tweak: "Pipes and atmos machinery now processes in tune with air, rather than seperately."
  - bugfix: "Fixed hotspots and fire causing more lag than they needed to"
  - bugfix: "Fixed some objects not getting garbage collected because they didn't properly clear references in Destory()"
  - tweak: "The qdel subsystem will now limit its processing time to a 5th of a second each tick to prevent lag when a lot of deletes happen"
  - bugfix: "Fixed the ticker not showing a tip of the round if an admin forces the round to start immediately"
