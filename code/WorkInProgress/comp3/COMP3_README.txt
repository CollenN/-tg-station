Current issue: The ROM and HDD wont sync up to the computer, preventing the
computer from running. The circuitboard also wont go into the Computer Frame,
preventing construction

Any coder who fixes this should repaste the changed files. Feel free to also
port other programs (Computer1 computers) as well.
